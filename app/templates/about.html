        <h1>What is PraxTrain?</h1>
      </div>
      <p>PraxTrain is for anyone who desires to put their faith into practice every day. It is specifically for those who desire to train themselves to live the way that Jesus lived. How did Jesus live? His actions were completely in line with His theology. His teachings were accompanied by actions. In modern terms, He practiced what He preached.  </p>

      <p>PraxTrain stands for Praxis Training. </p>
       
      <p> Praxis simply means a theory that is put into practice.</p>
      <p>Training in an athletic or professional sense recognizes that people develop skills, strength and competence with practice over a period of time.</p>

      <p>Every day there will be at least one, but as many as six different prompts for ways that you can train yourself to put your faith into practice.  The six elements that will make up the "Daily Praxis" are: Bible reading, Scripture memorization, verse meditation, journal reflection, intercessory prayer and faith activation. </p>

      <p>We hope you will join us in this journey of putting our faith into practice.</p>

        <p>a. Practical application of a theory<br>
         b. Theory put into practice</p>

        <li>Is this a devotional? </li>
        <p>No, PraxTrain consists of six different elements of training.  Bible Reading, Scripture memorization, verse reflection, journal reflection, intercessory prayer and faith activation.  </p>

        <li>What do the six elements of training mean?  </li>
        <p>Bible Reading: We will read through different portions of the Old and New Testament.  Sometimes it will be a combination of both in a day, sometimes it will be a few verses, sometimes a few chapters.  We will vary the reading plan throughout the year.   </p>
        <p>Scripture Memorization: On average, the scripture memorization will be about 1 verse every week.</p>
        <p>Verse Meditation: We will have one or two verses that you can spend 5-10 minutes meditating on.  This simply means reading the verse multiple times slowly and thinking deeply about what it means and how it applies to you.  </p>
        <p>Journal Reflection: We will ask you a simple question or have a journaling prompt that will encourage deeper reflection on an aspect of your life, your experiences, your beliefs, or what the Lord is speaking to you.  </p>
        <p>Intercessory Prayer: We will have a specific prayer request that you can pray about that is relevant to you personally, to the global Church, or to current events in our world.  </p>
        <p>Faith Activation: We will activate our faith by giving you a specific way for your to live out your faith.  Examples might include: give a co-worker a word of encouragement; give away $20 anonymously; help shovel a neighbors driveway.  </p>

        <li>Who came up with this idea? </li>
        <p>Someone who needed help putting their faith into practice!  Also someone who recognizes that daily reminders to read, to meditate, and to be action oriented will help followers of Jesus live out their mandate to build God's Kingdom here on earth.  </p>

        <li>What does the Bible reading plan break down to be? </li>
        <p>It will vary.  Sometimes it will be longer chunks of Scripture in one book.  Sometimes it might be only a couple verses.  Sometimes it will be both the Old Testament and New Testament.  Sometimes it will be a "rest day" to catch up on past readings, or to just take more time to pray or worship.  </p>
